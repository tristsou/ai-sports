## **2. How It Works**  

### **A. Data Collection from Multiple Sources**
1. **IMU Sensors** (Smartwatch, phone, or standalone IMUs) collect **motion and orientation data**.  
2. **E-Textile Sensors** (pressure/stretch sensors) measure **body position, muscle movement, and weight distribution**.  
3. **Video-Based Pose Estimation**  
   - A camera (phone/webcam) records movement.  
   - Uses **OpenPose, MediaPipe, or a custom Deep Learning model (e.g., PoseNet, MMPose)** to detect **body key points** (joint angles, posture alignment).  
   - Synchronizes video data with IMU + e-textile readings for better **motion tracking accuracy**.  
4. **Data Transmission**  
   - IMU data via **Bluetooth (smartwatch/phone)**  
   - E-textile data via **microcontroller (ESP32/Arduino BLE)**  
   - Video data via **Wi-Fi or direct processing on a computer/smartphone**

### **B. AI & Machine Learning for Motion & Posture Analysis**
1. **Sensor Fusion & Feature Extraction**
   - **IMU, e-textile, and video pose data** are merged for a more **accurate motion representation**.  
   - Uses **sensor fusion algorithms** (Kalman filters, complementary filters) to reduce noise.  

2. **Deep Learning Model for Posture & Activity Classification**  
   - **CNN/LSTM-based neural network** trained on **sensor + video data** classifies movement patterns.  
   - Example classifications:  
     - Correct vs. Incorrect Posture  
     - Sitting vs. Standing vs. Walking  
     - Running Gait & Stride Efficiency  
     - Balance & Stability Detection  
     - Rehabilitation Exercise Accuracy  

3. **LLM-Powered AI Feedback**  
   - AI processes **classified movement patterns** and generates **personalized feedback** using an **LLM (GPT-4, Llama, Claude, etc.)**.  
   - Example AI feedback:
     - **Posture Coaching:** _"You're slouching too much—try adjusting your spine to a neutral position."_  
     - **Running Form Optimization:** _"Your knee angle during running is too sharp. Try increasing your stride length slightly."_  
     - **Rehabilitation Support:** _"Your knee rehab exercise isn't at full range of motion. Try extending your leg fully."_
